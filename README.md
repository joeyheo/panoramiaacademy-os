# panoramiaacademy-os
A website to keep track of student's attendance, assignments, personal information, enrolled classes and so on.

Panoramia Academy is a volunteer organization that focuses on spreading knowledge to many local elementary school students around the region of Jeju. In order to accomplish certain tasks, Panoramia Academy OS will serve as a website that volunteers will access in order to keep both the parents and students updated about student's attendance, assignment, and improvements that they can make to improve.
